// started its movement in, and each system it moves through". The engine opens the hold after the
// ship is chosen, with every system of the route it computed (crates/ti4-engine/src/transit.rs
// `CargoWindow::for_ship`), but the move offer does not say which systems that route crosses. The
// UI therefore predicts the route the way `MovementRules::path_from_ship` finds it: breadth first
// over hex neighbours (and shared wormholes), neighbours in system-id string order, the first route
// to reach the active system wins. A wrong prediction is harmless: the engine only offers pickups
// on its own route, so a staged pickup that is not on it makes the batch fail before anything is
// applied.
