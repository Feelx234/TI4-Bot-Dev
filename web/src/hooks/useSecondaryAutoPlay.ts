 * Auto mode: sends the prepared answer for the viewer's own pending decision, once, after a short

 * recorded submission, so nothing is spent before this decision is answered.
 *
 * The same "armed" rule as the lone-case auto-submit (undo safety): a decision is auto-answered
 * only when the game moved FORWARD to it (the history cursor grew with nothing to redo before or
 * after) since the previous decision was evaluated. A page load, a reconnect that changed nothing,
 * an undo, a redo and a restore never arm it, so a decision reached by undoing is always asked.
 * Each nonce is evaluated once; a failed submit is not retried. Multi-step plans (follow, then the
 * technology) are armed again by their own forward progress, and stop at the first step that does
 * not validate (`review`) or that the plan has nothing to say about (`none`).
 *
 * A generation change disarms too, except when it is a batch commit: the session was replaced, the
 * log only grew and the cursor moved forward (see `logExtended`). Otherwise every batch (a move, a
 * production, a token purchase by any seat) would turn a prepared answer into a manual question.
