//! The pinned random source.
//!
//! Everything random in a game comes from here, so that a game is reproducible from its
//! seed and its decision log together. Reaching for a thread RNG anywhere else silently
//! breaks replay, which is why nothing else in the engine depends on `rand` directly.
//!
//! # Domain separation
//!
//! One stream for the whole game would couple every random decision to every other: adding
//! a die roll early in a round would shift the agenda deck, the exploration deck, and every
//! later roll. A regression test pinned to a seed would then fail for reasons unrelated to
//! what changed, and — worse — a fix that changed the *number* of rolls would silently
//! renumber every later draw.
//!
//! So each purpose draws from its own stream, seeded by hashing the game seed together with
//! the domain name. Streams are independent: consuming from one never moves another.
//!
//! # Not the oracle's stream
//!
//! The oracle uses Python's Mersenne Twister through `random.Random(seed)`. Its shuffle is
//! not reproducible outside `CPython`, so this is a *native pinned* generator rather than a
//! port — which is what M03-006 specifies. The same seed therefore produces a different
//! (equally legal) game. Reproducing a specific oracle game needs its decision log, or the
//! legacy entropy translator planned in M03-007.
