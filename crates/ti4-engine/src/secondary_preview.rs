//! A read-only preview of what a follower's strategy-card secondary would ask if its window
//! opened right now.
//!
//! A client that wants to prepare a secondary while the primary resolves needs the real
//! questions (which technologies are researchable and what the 4 resources would be paid with,
//! which sites a structure may go on, which units the home system may build), not an estimate
//! worked out from public data: skips, waivers, discounts, supply and production limits all live
//! in the engine.
//!
//! The preview is computed by the engine's own flow, so it cannot drift from the real question:
//!
//! * the window question is built by [`StrategySecondaryWindow`] itself (`pending_choice`);
//! * the follow-up questions are produced by running [`crate::strategy_cards::follow`] (the very
//!   function the game driver calls) on a throwaway copy of the position with a decider that
//!   records the first question of the card's own kind and stops the flow there.
//!
//! It is read only by construction: the position is taken by shared reference and copied with
//! [`crate::game::detached_state`] (the copy gets its own turn-redo deck cursor, see the FORK RULE
//! in `AGENTS.md`); nothing here owns a `Game`, a decision log, an event list, a dice or random
//! stream, or storage. The flows that draw cards (Politics, Imperial) or ask nothing further
//! (Trade) are never run: for them the preview is the window question alone.
//!
//! What it cannot know is what happens between now and the moment the window really opens: the
//! primary's own effects, followers asked earlier in clockwise order and action cards. Callers
//! label the result "as of now" and re-check the plan against the real question when it opens.
