//! A copy of the live game at a step boundary, so a batch check need not replay the whole game.
//!
//! The session worker is the only caller of `Game::step`. At the top of each loop iteration,
//! before `step()`, the game is provably between steps, so a full copy can be taken there. A
//! batch check later forks that copy, replays only the decisions recorded since (the tail of
//! the step in progress) and then runs the staged choices (`batch::simulate`).
//!
//! The copy carries no decision log (the largest part of it, and the session already holds the
//! log): it records how long the log was and the last record, and a check rebuilds the log from
//! the prefix it validates against. A snapshot is used only when
//!
//! - it belongs to the history generation being checked,
//! - the log it was taken at is a prefix of the log being checked (same length bound and same
//!   last record), and
//! - it was taken with no deferred RNG work pending (`Game::flush_rng_sync` first).
//!
//! Every history change except appending decisions (undo, redo, restore, turn redo, batch
//! commit, recovery, history replacement) replaces the whole session, whose shared state starts
//! with no snapshot; the appends keep the prefix property, which is what `is_valid_for` checks.
//! Anything else falls back to the full replay.
