//! Forced random positions and card identity for replays of a redone timeline (H7 turn redo).
//!
//! A game's dice and decks come from seeded streams that only advance when something draws.
//! After a turn is redone, the decisions that follow it are other seats' recorded answers, made
//! against the *original* dice. If the new turn drew a different number of dice, a plain replay
//! from the seed would hand those later decisions different faces. A history therefore carries
//! `rng_marks`: for some decision indexes, where every stream stood when the decision was
//! answered. Every replay path restores those positions before the decision's consequences draw.
//! The game seed is never touched; only stream positions move.
//!
//! Cards are different: decks are shuffled once and drawn from the front, so the same marks also
//! carry a [`DeckPlan`] that makes a draw of the recorded tail take the card it took originally
//! (see `ti4_model::deck_reserve`). The replay driver tells the force which decision it is
//! answering ([`RngForce::before_answer`]) and when the recorded decisions are over
//! ([`RngForce::go_live`]).
