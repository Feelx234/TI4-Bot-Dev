//! Turn redo (H7): replay a seat's last turn, then auto-play the round from other seats' records.
//!
//! The game seed is fixed. A request rewinds the live history to the start of the seat's turn;
//! the seat plays a new turn live; [`autoplay`] then replays the decisions that followed the old
//! turn, with the strict matcher of [`crate::session::splice`]: the other seats' recorded
//! decisions *and* the redoing seat's own recorded decisions that are not a turn start (reaction
//! windows, secondaries of other seats' strategy cards, agenda votes, picks...). It keeps each
//! only while it still fits and stops
//!
//! * when the redoing seat's next *turn* begins (control returns to it), or
//! * at the first decision that no longer fits (the seat the engine asks decides live), or
//! * when the recorded tail is exhausted.
//!
//! Whatever follows the stop stays in the saved alternate timeline.
//!
//! # Dice
//!
//! The dice and the deck shuffles come from per-domain seeded streams that only advance on a
//! draw. If the new turn drew more or fewer dice than the old one, a plain replay would hand the
//! recorded decisions that follow different faces. So the original timeline is replayed once to
//! read where every stream stood at each decision ([`prepare_tail`]); the auto-play then restores
//! those positions before each kept decision is answered, and stores them on the new history as
//! `rng_marks` so every later replay (recovery, undo, restart) reproduces the same dice.
//!
//! # Cards
//!
//! Decks are shuffled once at setup and drawn from the front, so forcing stream positions does
//! not help them. Instead the card each recorded draw took in the original timeline is read from
//! the same baseline replay (`ti4_model::deck_reserve`). While the new turn is played, draws skip
//! the cards reserved for that tail and take the next ones further down the deck; when the tail
//! is replayed, each recorded draw takes the very card it took originally, from wherever it sits
//! now. The reservations travel with the history in `rng_marks`. A reserved card that is gone is
//! a [`ConflictKind::ReservedCard`] conflict handing the decision to the seat the engine asks.
