//! The read-only secondary preview a seated follower can ask for while a strategic action is in
//! progress (see `ti4_engine::secondary_preview` for how the answer is computed).
//!
//! What this module guarantees:
//!
//! * **Read only.** It takes the session lock only to check eligibility and to copy the newest
//!   published position (`latest_state`: the state at the top of the worker loop or at the last
//!   nested offer, whichever is fresher while a step is running), then releases it. The
//!   computation runs on the caller's thread on the copy; the worker is never waited on, and the
//!   game, its RNG, the decision log, the event log and storage are never touched.
//! * **Private.** The answer goes only to the connection that asked, for that connection's own
//!   seat. It is computed from that seat's own holdings and the public board.
//! * **Only when it means something.** A seated follower, while the action phase's latest action
//!   is a strategic action by another seat whose card is still unexhausted, and before that seat
//!   has been asked anything of the action. Anything else is refused with a reason.
//!
//! The freshest position available while the primary is mid-step is the one published at its
//! last nested offer; before the primary's first question it is the position at the top of the
//! step, i.e. BEFORE the primary. Either way the answer is "as of now": the primary's remaining
//! effects, followers asked earlier in clockwise order and action cards can still change what the
//! real question offers, so a client re-checks its plan against the real question.
