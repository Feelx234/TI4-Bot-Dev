# Round 1 (scheduled for FIX1_HHMM): the first request of a night writes $NIGHT_DIR/fix-requested
# and nightly.sh decide_night treats round 1 as due.
# Once round 1 has started, the first request after that writes $NIGHT_DIR/fix-requested-2 instead
# (the reason reaches the round 2 prompt); round 2 then starts early as soon as round 1 has
# finished, while the sweep keeps running. Further requests are refused, as are all requests once
# round 2 has started or when no round is enabled: such a problem goes into the report entry.
